WHAT IS ENUM?
    creating the range of the constant we will use the enumeration
but the forst version of the java does not contained the enumeration feature
that time we would be using  the static keyword that wooud assign the  constant number to the particular data ,
but there was an ambiguity in identifying and detecting the difference betweeen the string ang integer as they both are initially
assumed as the same



syntax for enumeration or enum
    enum(keyword) name of enum (class)
    {
        //names of constant//
        basketball,football,cricket;(semi colon is not compulsory)


    }
public class enumeration
{
    public static void main(String args[])
        {
            System.out.println(enum.basketball);
        }
}
note: we can define the enum class inside the class as well
but not in the method (any method)
